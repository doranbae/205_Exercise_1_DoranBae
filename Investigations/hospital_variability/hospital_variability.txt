Q: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

A: 
# Top 10 results (procedures, minScore, maxScore, diffScore)
ED1	0	1140	1140
ED2	0	753	753
Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention	17	409	392
OP 18	46	424	378
Door to diagnostic eval	0	160	160
Median time to pain med	14	167	153
Median Time to ECG	0	114	114
Initial antibiotic selection for CAP in immunocompetent patient	0	100	100
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis	0	100	100
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis	0	100	100

# Calculation
From variability_table, I got measurenames(=procedures), and min and max score for each procedure. Then I subtracted minScore from maxScore in order to get diffScore. DiffScore represents variability between procedures. 

# Justification why this approach is appropriate
In "Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv", each procedure is scored per hospital. Therefore greatest variability can be calculated by finding the difference between max and min score for that particular procedure. Insteand of using a subset table, procedureQualitytable, I decided to use effective_care table in order to shorten the investigation process.

# Why these results support your conclusion
ED1 procedure's score range is 1140, which means that its min score is 0, whereas its max score is 1140. On the other hand, Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis has range of 100. This means ED1 has a greater variability per hospital. 

# Conclusion
ED1 has the greatest variability per hospital.
