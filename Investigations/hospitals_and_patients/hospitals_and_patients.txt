Q: Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

A: There is almost no correlation (-0.23941891948182795)

# Calculation
In order to calculate correlation between hospital quality and procedural variability, I have used the following definitions.
Corr (x, y) = Corr (quality score, average procedure score)
x (quality score) = survey results for each score (from quality)
y (average procedure score) = For the purpose of this investigation, I have assumed that a greater variability is present when average procedure score is higher. 

After creating a table for x, y, I ran corr function in Hive.

# Justification why this approach is appropriate
In this investigation, we are calculation correlation at the hospital level. 

# Why these results support your conclusion
The correlation resulted in -0.23 which indicates that there is little or no correlation between patient satisfaction level (=care quality) and procedure quality.

# Conclusion
The results shows that quality (=patient satisfaction) is not highly correlated to procedure quality
